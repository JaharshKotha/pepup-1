        <h4>ZUMBA - ZUMBA THE FIVE LETTER MAGIC WORD!</h4>
        <p>
          Beto Perez forgot his tape of aerobics music for a class he was teaching. He went to his car, listened to music – consisting of non-traditional salsa and merengue music – and improvised a class using this non-traditional aerobics music. This is now shaped up as ZUMBA.

          Zumba, the hybrid Latin dance workout is exceptional thanks to the fact that it made fitness accessible to multitudes of people. Since it incorporates elements of Latin dance into a workout, it seems less intimidating than most workouts out there. Why is that, you ask?

          Well, for starters, it’s basically dance, and who doesn’t like to dance! Even people with seven left feet will find themselves moving to Zumba beats that are reminiscent of genres like Salsa, Cumbia, Reggaeton and Hip-Hop. Lifting those feet, punching those feet and shaking that booty are all essential components of a Zumba workout.

          Of course, the other great thing about Zumba is that it can be customized for different audiences and to suit different requirements.  Aqua Zumba, as the name suggests, is done with the help of water. Zumba Step is a micro-version dedicated to lower-body training. Zumba Gold is a certified fitness programme for the elderly, while Zumba Sentao makes use of chairs to tone and strengthen the body. Zumba is just like Disneyland - there’s something for everyone.

          There you have it - energetic and customizable to your needs, Zumba is an amazingly fun way to inject fitness into your life. Plus, you get to learn some really cool moves. It’s one hell of a bargain, if we ever saw one.
          Try out ZUMBA with Pepup.Today!

        <h4>Tapering for a Marathon</h4>
        <p>
         An artist works tirelessly on his painting and before he unveils the curtain on his finished canvas, he puts finishing touches to it. A ‘Taper’ is an athlete’s way of putting the finishing touch on his hard work while training for a Marathon.
Studies indicate that an efficient taper may last between one and four weeks. The optimal duration does not depend on age, experience or event distance. It depends on each athlete's adaptation and recovery profile. Some athlete’s  recover faster than others; some have long-lasting training adaptations, whereas some others detrain quickly.
However the three weeks tapering plan seems to be the most commonly used plan among marathoners.  The final three weeks are the most important in any marathon-training program. Hence an efficient taper is both a Science and an Art.
The Science of Taper shows that levels of muscle glycogen, enzymes, antioxidants, and hormones ,all depleted by high mileage, return to optimal ranges during a taper. The muscle damage that occurs during sustained training is also repaired. Muscle and connective tissues repair and strengthen. In addition the immune function and muscle strength improve, which reduces the odds that an athlete will catch a cold or get injured just before the race.  While it is true that rested muscles increase in strength and power output, many of the biggest gains occur in the circulatory system, where total blood volume and red blood cell counts increase. Tapered athletes sometimes note increases in running economy, while storing glycogen more readily.
When it comes to tapering ’ less is really more’.
The Art of Taper is to learn to chill and relax and back off  from training. That means you run less and rest more. It is an art to learn to modify your running, thinking, and eating in those three crucial weeks before you toe the line. Athletes are afraid to reduce their intensity and volume of training just before the big race, as they fear losing fitness and gaining weight. A long distance runner has to realize that in those last few weeks , it's the rest, more than the work, that makes you strong. And you don't lose fitness in three weeks of tapering. In fact, studies show that your aerobic capacity, the best gauge of fitness, doesn't change at all.
Tapering begins immediately upon completing your last longest training run .Tapering means reducing the volume of your weekly training mileage by 20 to 30 % EACH WEEK, from your highest volume week, for three weeks. For example if your highest weekly mileage was 64 kms, you would cut your mileage by 12 kms and mileage in WEEK 1 of your taper would be 52 kms.
In addition to cutting mileage keep your run intensity to your goal race pace and no faster. It is best to cut out on cross training during the taper period. You may however do upper body strength training in Week 1 of taper. Do not train lower body or cycle or spin in the three weeks of taper. Swimming can be done moderately for first two weeks of taper for relaxation  and drop it completely in the last week. Yoga and Pilates can be done in the first two weeks of taper and stop in the last week.
Keep stretching and doing core exercises throughout your taper.
During the taper period , it is necessary to make adjustments in your nutrition too. Increase protein intake in the first week of taper as the same is needed to repair muscle. It is important to increase your complex carbohydrates intake and reduce fat intake during the entire taper period. Drink a lot of fluids during these three weeks and reduce caffeine and alcohol consumption as they are diuretics. A marginal weight gain during this period is normal and this will come handy during the Marathon.
Wishing  all the BOSCH Marathon participants a strong training run!

        <h4>5 things you must know before running the Marathon</h4>
        <p>
         First of all, congratulations! Congratulations on being a tiny set of people who happily wake up at 6:00 am on a Sunday morning to train while most of planet earth is asleep and their bodies are working hard to recover from all the trash that was put into the system Saturday night.
Perhaps it is the runner's high (a colloquial term used to describe the feeling of extreme euphoria experienced during running) which drives you to spring out of bed at the crack of dawn. Irrespective of where your motivation comes from, know that your decision to run the marathon is inspiring more people than you think.
Thus, for you, some guidelines as you move forward in your training:
1. Pre and post workout meals
A fruit 30-minutes pre-workout and a meal immediately post workout is imperative for improved workout performance and optimal muscle repair and recovery
2.Strengthen back, legs and weight-bearing joints (knee, hips, spine)
Let me elucidate this pointer via a quick story:
Clients after a few weeks of a good food routine are keen to take things to the next level i.e. commence workouts. They start running and within a week or so, complain of an aching back, an aching ankle, an aching knee etc. “Running isn't good for me” is the prompt conclusion they inevitably come to. It's not the running silly! It's the fact that your back, legs, knees, hips etc. aren't strong enough to take the impact of the run. Do you see where I am going with this story?

Marathon training isn't merely confined to teaching yourself how to sprint and how to run long distances. In fact, exercises to strengthen your body parts are just as important too! Set aside one training day for these so that you don't sustain injuries
3.If you haven't done so already, invest in a good pair of shoes
Yes, an investment; that's what it is. Purchase as per your arch and don't sport a brand new pair right before the run. Ensure you have already ran in said shoes and are comfortable with them. If you already own a decent pair of shoes, check the outsole (material in contact with the ground) and the midsole (shoe cushioning) for cracks and fissures. If you spot any, maybe it's time for a new pair
4.  Hydrate and Sleep
Muscles can cramp due to dehydration which is the last thing you want. So continually sip water through the day and ensure you're adequately hydrated at all times. Your muscles won't recover adequately unless you get your sleep. So here's your early to bed excuse.
5. Stop obsessing over completion time
The fact that you're training is in itself a huge accomplishment even though it may or may not seem like it to you. On the D-day, enjoy the run as opposed to obsessing over how much time it takes to complete it.
So that's it, a smile on your face and a spring in your step (literally)! Good luck!
